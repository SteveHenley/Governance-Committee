## Governance Committee Charter<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

Approved in the Aug 6, 2019 RChain board meeting. [(link)](https://github.com/rchain/board/tree/master/2019/08-06#governance-committee-charter)

## Purpose and Objectives

The Governance Committee (the team) will: 

*   Provide advisory oversight of RCchain Co-operative Governance – the organising structure and processes of decision-making; 

*   Ensure that governance design and practice reflects, and balances:​
    *   Co-op member voice​
    *   Executive representative leadership​
    *   Expert engagement​ 

*   Design for effective, efficient and  shared  governance in line with co-op values and principles

*   Provide planning and coordination of major governance change​; 

*   Support the Co-op, its functions and members with appropriate guidance and recommend tools where appropriate.

## Scope and Constraints

The role of the team is constrained to providing the _minimum necessary_ over-arching design and coordination in order to maximise innovation, independence and self-reliance of the functions / domains  that make up the Co-op.  It is concerned with the ‘end to end’ effectiveness and efficiency of processes, including their measurement, rather than the design of governance for any or all component elements or functions<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> of the co-op. 

The team will be guided by the Co-op [values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDKiBgbKcPH6-wsW8wKLcLc19rBacbqZXtrtgkcaqN4/edit)<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> and ICA-based [principles](https://github.com/rchain/board/blob/master/2019/08-06/ica-guidance-notes-en-310629900.pdf) which are agreed independently by the membership.

The team recommends / proposes governance designs or changes for ratification by the members/executives.

The team has no operational accountability for executive functional decisions or judgements, but by exception may review governance decisions or disputes, as part of an audit or an extraordinary appeal requested by the executive or by approved member petition.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

The team may advise on measures and measurement systems for performance management within the Co-op, but will not routinely measure or assess operational performance _other than the governance team’s own performance measurement._

The team is expected to remain independent of, while acting  as a trusted advisor to:

*   The Members
*   the Executive
*   Individual Experts and Expert groups<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

## Key Stakeholders

Membership of the Co-op​ - the Members 

The Executive / Governing Board​ - the Board 

The ‘Expert’ Functions / Domains 
E.g. Audit and Finance Committee, Engineering, Marketing and so on

Ecosystem Partner / Portfolio Boards

## Team and Roles

Chair – convenes, represents, facilitates and provides arbitration / priority setting.  May delegate activity to other members acting as ‘guides’ on a particular agenda topic. 

Deputy Chair also to be appointed. Additional responsibilities are identified in the RACI section below.

Board Liaison - one member will provide representation of board interests, having a seat as an observer on board meetings.  The board liaison member and the Chair will normally represent the Governance Committee at the Rchain coop board.   Governance committee representation will normally be required ad-hoc at other meetings such as Audit, Nominations and Compensation committee.

A deputy  Chair member will be required in order to share load / provide coverage.  Additional responsibilities:  see RACI

Resourcing and Workplan - one member will focus on managing the workplan and securing representation / engagement / resources from:

*   Functional / Domain governance representatives – e.g. Engineering, Marketing, Finance, Legal.   Accountable for overall governance in the domain they represent.  Attendance may be scheduled according to agenda subject matter i.e. function reps need not attend if no topic is relevant to their domain.
*   Ecosystem partner reps:  e.g. LifeID.  Advise / report on governance concerns and interactions with the RChain ecosystem
*   Governance / social ledger Subject Matter Experts  – e.g. @jimscarver @dckc @ela ..and External advisory as and when required e.g. platform.coop / consulting
*   Rchain Europe and Asia​ representatives…  (Assuming _one_ Co-op for now)

Additional responsibilities:  see RACI

Note:  the Scribe role at meetings is ideally rotated.

## Measurement and Reporting

The team will report its actions, progress and recommendations to the Board and the Members at board meetings.

The team will report any proposed changes to the governance charter to the board and members.

Provide a self-evaluation of the team performance on a regular (ongoing) basis:



*   Proposals received, reviewed, submitted, approved.
*   Audits / investigations/special tasks commissioned, in progress, completed.
*   Member engagement - dialogues / interactions
*   Publications - newsletters, guidelines
*   Qualitative feedback from stakeholders


## Ways of Working

The team is expected to define and agree to its own internal ways of working provided they are in line with Co-op values and principles and fulfil the obligations as defined in this charter.

The team shall have no more than nine and no fewer than five members and shall require five members present to constitute a quorum for approving proposals or deciding a ruling when required by a process review or governance design task.

The team will usually<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup> meet no more than twice per month, between regular Board meetings.

The team may propose changes to its (Governance Committee) charter to the Board at any time, for approval by simple majority vote of the Board.

Team members are expected to attend each meeting, in person or via telephone or videoconference and to be available for chat / async comms between meetings.

Meeting agendas will be prepared for every meeting and provided to the team members at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled meeting, along with the appropriate materials needed to make informed decisions.

The team shall act only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the team members at a meeting or by unanimous consent. Minutes of these meetings are to be recorded.

Governance proposals, agendas, calendars and meeting minutes will be published in an appropriate, agreed location, accessible to Co-op members and available publicly.

For the purpose of maintaining collective memory within the Governance Committee the terms of Committee Members (“Members”) will become staggered and overlapping as follows:

Except in situations where shorter terms are expressly permitted under this Charter, Committee Members (“Members”) will serve for terms of three years. In the initial Meeting of the Committee, Members will be divided into three groups composed of as near an equal number of Members as possible (each, a “Group”). The terms of all Members within a particular Group will be set to expire at the same time, and the respective terms of the three Groups will be set to expire in three different consecutive years, with the purpose of staggering Member terms each year so approximately one third of Member seats are up for election each year.

An elected Member’s term will continue beyond his or her stated term until his or her successor is elected. The Chair, if not an elected Member, will serve on the Committee ex officio and will cease to be a Member immediately upon ceasing to hold the position of Chair. A Member designated by the Committee to fill the seat of an elected Member whose seat has become vacant for any reason shall have a term of office until the next election, which may result in that Member’s seat being placed in a different Group. The Committee shall have authority to designate the members of the three Groups of elected Members and their respective terms, and may from time to time prescribe terms for Members or nominees of less than three years, but not more than three years, for particular elected Members or nominees to the extent it considers such shortened terms to be reasonably necessary to achieve or maintain the required balance of staggered terms among the elected Members. No action by the Committee to prescribe a shortened term for an elected Member shall have the effect of shortening the term of an incumbent elected Member without his or her consent.

### A1 - Background Note

The RChain Co-op is an innovation in the technology it provides and an innovation as a Co-operative organisation in the technology industry.  It has experienced rapid and exciting growth, with great organisational and commercial change and severe financial challenges towards the end of 2018. The mission, values and principles of the Co-op and the commitment of its membership remain strong, but in the pace and stress of delivery and change in day to day operations it has lacked the structure, stability and diligence in decision-making necessary to maintain confidence among stakeholders.  The new executive committee has identified the need for a specialist function in the Co-op accountable for oversight of RChain Co-op governance design in line with the RChain Coop goal of being at once _co-operative_ and _effective_. There is a tension between practical and effective governance in the Co-op and the democratic ideal of separation of the three powers<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup> of governance (as in the state) —legislative, executive and judicial—each having their own separate institution.  Governance design should achieve adequate separation without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy and friction.  Accordingly, the Governance Committee, principally accountable to the membership for the _design _of governance, does not make day to day business decisions (it is not ‘executive’) nor does it make judgements on failure to follow agreed process (‘judiciary’).  However, in a collaborative and collective enterprise such as RChain Co-op, all three ‘powers’ are represented and are expected to engage in open, transparent discussion and debate within the committee.

### A2 - Definitions

**RChain Co-op** -  including its membership and operating units in the US, Europe, Asia, Africa.

**Governance** - “is a _structure_ within which people make decisions about what the Co-op aims to do and how it aims to do it, and make judgements about whether or not it has been successful. Whether or not a Co-op is successful depends in part on the quality of its governance.”<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup>  Governance includes <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the structure _and dynamics_ of the governing system</span> and is distinct from day to day operations and decisions.  It is recursive and complex -  the Co-op will inevitably comprise many sub-systems, each with appropriate governance appropriate to their immediate purpose and environment.

**Committee** - is a _team_ composed of RChain Co-op members qualified to perform the roles identified in the section ‘Team and Roles’ below.  The ‘committee’ is expected to perform as a team, and is referred to as ‘the team’ throughout this document.

**Executive** - The _accountable_<sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup> operational leadership bodies of the Co-op, including the leadership of its departmental functions and Vice Presidents typically<sup>[14](#myfootnote14)</sup> Marketing, Engineering / Development, Finance and Audit, Legal, Partner Relations, Human Resources (and so on) its President and Governing Board

**Membership** - the current members of the Co-op within the meaning of the Membership Policy

**Functions** - the specialist and _expert_ operational domains / departments / teams / bodies that make up the explicit organisation structure of the Co-op

### Risk Management

The following risks and mitigations have been considered:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Risk
   </td>
   <td>Impact
   </td>
   <td>Mitigation
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Poor participation and engagement by Coop membership in cttee
   </td>
   <td>Weakness in member voice in governance, erosion of confidence in leadership.   Conflict and poor decisions in longer term
   </td>
   <td>Strong communication plan and effort, including regular news/updates. Open livestreaming of meetings and prompt handling of comments / questions. Ensure active participation by a respected member representative on cttee.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Dominating influence of executive
   </td>
   <td>Governance recommendations ignored / overridden.  Hierarchical behaviours emerge.
   </td>
   <td>Invite external moderation and advice.
<p>
Appeal (by exception) to membership for overriding petition / veto?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Evolving governance design becomes complex / too varied 
   </td>
   <td>Unworkable processes, high friction, poor effectiveness and high cost.  Member frustration.
   </td>
   <td>Independent review. 
Board or members can petition to mandate simplification.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Policy and processes evolve / diverge to contravene local / national law / norms of behaviour
   </td>
   <td>Co-op exposed to litigation / damage to external perception and relationships
   </td>
   <td>Ensure values / principles are fit for purpose and consult with legal counsel / domain specialists where appropriate
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### A3 - Example Visualisations

#### Simple Charter Template

All business/organisation units within the RChain Co-operative are expected to publish a charter.

The charter should be structured as follows, normally formatted as a .doc document but optionally supported by succinct [‘one pager’ summaries in say, powerpoint](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=6AC8D9A78832189B!956&ithint=file%2cpptx&app=PowerPoint&authkey=!AMCOrfMbvAIn1iw).

*   Purpose and Objectives
*   Scope and Constraints
*   Key Stakeholders
*   Team and Roles
    *   Criteria for Membership
    *   Link to Appointment / Election Process
*   Team Interfaces
*   Key Tasks and Deliverables (optional)
*   RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
*   Measurement and Reporting
*   Ways of Working
*   Appendix (any supporting material / artefact definitions, including background and links)

#### Organisation Map

The over-arching organisation structure of the Co-op will be represented on a suitable ‘landscape’ map showing the organization units, their positioning (in relation to appropriate axes) and their relationship to other bodies and units.  Each unit will negotiate their positioning and relationship with other bodies in order to come to agreement and the Governance Committee will broker agreement and resolve disputes / gaps where necessary, making recommendations to the board as appropriate.  Process guides or navigators will be provided so that members new to the Co-op can easily find out ‘How do I get x done around here?’ in conjunction with the governance wiki or similar document.

### A4 - Candidate Early Tasks

Review of Member On-boarding process.

Review of executive/operational board meeting decision quora / majority criteria.

Review of the current governing documents of the co-op.
